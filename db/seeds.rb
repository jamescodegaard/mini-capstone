# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

# product = Product.new(name: "Gucci Slides", price: 10, image_url: "https://cache.mrporter.com/variants/images/666467151987779/fr/w2000_q80.jpg", description: "Not counterfeit.")
